# Signlanguage-convertor
This project gives an interface to user for converting sign language into text.You can implement it into audio.
The Data used in the program is taken from lsa64 which i had implemented only 10 signs.The above data does not belong to me,it is only taken for research purpose not for the commericial purpose.Beware of copyright.
As comming to project,I had differntiated all the files from extracting landmarks to training model.
The main.py is file where we implement the real life data convertion (camera must be functional).
As comming for the technologies most of them are mentioned in the code.Read it,It is very easy to implement.
Thank you for viewing my code.
